# Yet unnamed space game in Unity with a lot of violence

## What is it about?

It's a loose 3D clone of [Jetz Rampage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9mFjAjjryk). It can be summed up like this:
* Fly around with your hovercraft in a cyber city
* Be a psycho and kill lots of innocent citizens
* The police will hunt you down - the game will be super difficult!
* There will be some boring non violent quests for noobs who want to earn money for better guns!

## TODO

The formula for todo list priority is following:

Priority = task importance / task difficulty, where both input variables have range 1-5

example: importance of intro menu is 1, difficulty is 3 -> therefore priority is 1/3 = 0.33

1. 3D flying player's car 5/2 = 2.5
1. Other flying cars 3/3 = 1
1. Infinite Space Loop 3/3 = 1

Anyway, just do what you think will be most fun!
